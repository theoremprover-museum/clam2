In a document using this style file, you can access the DReaM
bibliography database via \dreambib.  Since the DReaM bibliography is
split accross a few files, the intention is that this will provide an
easier to use interface.

For example, 

	\bibliography{personalbibs.bib,\dreambib,otherbibs}

gives access to all the entrys in the bib files `personalbibs' and
otherbibs in additions each of those in the DReaM bibliography.

	\bibliographystyle{\dreambibstyle}

gives the standard DReaM style (well, I think it's standard).
