Making Oyster/Clam
------------------

To compile and run Clam you will need SICStus
Prolog (you will also need the "make" program to help compile Clam),
and you will need the Oyster distribuition.  (Both Oyster and Clam
distributions come in the Oyster/Clam distribution.)

1.  Configuration.
      * Building the Prolog saved state may need the setting of
	certain variables in clam/make/Makefile:

	The variable SRC should default to the top-level dierctory of
	distribution.   Continuing the example above, this would be
	SRC=.../oyster-clam 

	This version only runs under sicstus v4.

	Set SOCKET_SUPPORT=yes if you want to compile socket support.

      * (OPTIONAL) Edit the config files in the clam/config/ directory
	to adjust the pre-loaded methods, hints and tactics.  

2.  Make a Prolog saved state of Clam.
	cd into the .../oyster-clam/clam/make/ directory and type
	
	make

	"make clean" will empty the directory of everything not 
	present in the distribution.
	
	The Prolog saved state containing Oyster/Clam will be
	clam.sic; the script ' clam ' in that directory runs clam.

3.  The Clam manual can be found in clam/info-for-users/clam-manual/manual.ps.
    Type "make" there to LaTeX the manual to produce a DVI file (but
    without the University crest on the first page).
 
    The Oyster manual is in the oyster directory;  type "make" there
    to build a DVI file.  It is not necessary to know about oyster
    to use the Clam system.

4. 
To run the small benchmark.

?- trace_plan(_,20).               % terse (optional)
?- trace_plan(_,23).               % verbose (optional)
?- trace_plan(_,40).               % very verbose (optional)
?- do_all(dplan(Time),save,1).     % timeout Time in milliseconds for each 
                                   % plan formation;
                                   % dplan(60000) should be enough.
